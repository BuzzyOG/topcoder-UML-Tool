topcoder UML Tool
=================

We're proud to introduce the TopCoder UML Tool: An easy to use, consistent modeling tool for use in Design and Development competitions. The new tool was designed and developed entirely by the TopCoder Community to model sequence, class, use case, and activity diagrams. On top of that, all those elements can have documentation easily attached to them. 

Install the UML tool on Linux and Windows
=============================================
Make sure the machine you are installing on has the proper version of Java (1.7).

Execute installer jar. The OS may support doing this in the GUI, or you can use the command line:

java -jar TopCoder_UML_Tool_Installer-1.2.6.jar

Follow instructions on installer screen.

If you have any questions or you would just like to discuss the UML Tool, go to the forums.
	Installer issue
Some operating systems supposedly don't support creating shortcuts (icons) according to izPack documentation.
